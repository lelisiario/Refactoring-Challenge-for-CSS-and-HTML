# Refactoring-Challenge-for-CSS-and-HTML
In this file I have refactored the HTML and the CSS code.

For the HTML:
I condensed the links in the unordered list to be all in one section instead of their own sections.
    I attempted to put all of the benefit sections into one benefit section, but it kept changing the layout, so I reverted it back to it's origional starter code.
I changed the footer to <h4> to follow numerical order.
I added alt text to all images.
I added more more starter code to include additions to lines 6 and 7.
I changed most of the divs to more semantic element tags.

For the CSS:
I added comments to help identify different sections of the code.
I condensed the "benefits" functionality code.
I added comments to differentiate "benefits" sections functionalities from the "benefits" images.
